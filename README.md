Weird ideas that may get spun out into more complete repos, but are babies here

## Wifi Snooper Visualizer
- detects phones searching for wifi
- visualizes their wifi history, as well as the first part of their mac address (and thus their device type)

## Recursive Compression
- repeatedly compresses and then displays an image. How compressed can something get?
- using coding theory compression algorithms

## Cron jobs gone wild
- what kind of strange cron jobs can I dream up?

## Romantic Cycle DFA
