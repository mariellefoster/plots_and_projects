## Romantic Cycle DFA
- feelings and transition states in a person's romantic life
- way way down the road, could it be trained up on someone's emotional patterns and warn them or their loved ones when certain issues are beginning to reoccur. I.e. Partner A is not sleeping well, and experiencing paranoid thoughts. Warns Partner B, and  notifies Partner A that they should prioritize sleeping and lay off their coffee, which makes them anxious.

## Markov Marf
- Inspired by Markov Michelle
- Feed a markov chain my corpus of emails, see what comes out

## Twitter Server
- Posts on twitter random packets it intercepts
  - What packets would be interesting?
  - Point of anonymization, or publicity? 
  - i.e. "Someone is visiting this website" vs. "This mac address is doing this thing"

## Schroedinger's button
- Push a button, 50% chance of seeing a live cat, 50% chance of seeing a dead cat :(
